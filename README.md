# Customer Segmentation using RFM and K-Means Clustering

To perform customer segmentation we will first utilize RFM modeling to calculate the RFM scores for each customer and then we will apply unsupervised machine learning technique called k-Means to group those customers into different groups based on RFM scores calculated.


## Installation

This project requires Python 3.7 and the following Python libraries installed:



- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.7 installer and not the Python 2.x installer.
